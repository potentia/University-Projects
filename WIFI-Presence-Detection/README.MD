# My contrabution to the WIFI-Presence-Detection Group project

This the the code that I wrote for my final group project in first year.

The projcet was using software on a raspberry pi to detect nearby wifi devices such as phones and laptops and storing these devices in a database.
I was mainly resposable for dealing with the raspbery pi and making sure it was setup correctly and trouble shooting any issues we had.
The rest of the grop where resposable for project management and web desding
