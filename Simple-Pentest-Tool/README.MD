# Simple Pentest Tool

This was the first project we where tasked with at uni in our first year. We where told to upgrade some basic exsisitng code and add a list of features. This tool was then used to hack a machine and get root.

This tool that enuerates open ports, checks for anoumous ftp, enumerates directorys on a web server, enumarates local linux users and more.
